# Phishing Detection Using Machine Learning

This project implements supervised learning models (Gradient Boosting and XGBoost)
to detect phishing websites using URL-based engineered features.

## Structure
- `data/`: dataset used for experiments.
- `models/`: trained ML models (.pkl files).
- `src/`: training, evaluation and feature engineering scripts.
- `app/`: Flask application for prediction.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for experiments.
- `report/`: Scientific paper (IEEE style).
